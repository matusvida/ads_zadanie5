Deformatipon 21 A35 n3ver and river response Before specific examples of syntectonic impacts on alluvial rivers can be discussed a brief review of types of tectonic activity types of rivers and river response will be presented This background material sets the stage for detailed discussions that follow Types of deformation The surficial movements in an alluvial valley can take different forms fs illustrated in Figure 21 The displacement can be seismic and associated jith earthquakes and abrupt faulting or it can be aseismic with progressive tilting and warping of the valley floor Faults may b lateral faults that displace or offset the channel Figure n21A without vertical displacement This type of displacement should be easily recognized Faults with vertical displacement may have tte uplifbted block upstream of the famlt with the result that gradient is steepened Figure 21B In the opposite case the gradient will be decreased Figure 21C The effect will resemble monoclinal tilting Figure 21F G Pjirs of faudts may produce uplifted horst or downdropped blocks graben that will both steepen and reduce gradient Figure 21D E This has the same effect as domes and anticlines or basins and synclines Figure 21H I In addition to all of these structural features the entire valley may be tilted upstream or downstream or the tilting may be across the valley toward either side of the floodplain Figure 21J K L The possibilities are great but in reality the result will be local steepening or reduction of gradient or crossvalley tilting Streams respond to vertical displacement along faults Figure 21B and C by aggradation or degradation When the displacement produces a channel segment steeper than the original stream gradient Figure 21B erosion will be initiated in this reach When the displacement produces a channel segment
